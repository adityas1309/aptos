🌍 Transparent Fair Trade Registry
A decentralized registry for fair trade products built on the Move smart contract language. It enables producers to register goods and provides transparency into product certification and verification processes.

📝 Project Description
Transparent Fair Trade Registry is a blockchain-powered platform that allows producers to register their fair trade products immutably on-chain. This system ensures that product origin, producer identity, and certification timestamps are publicly verifiable, reducing fraud and increasing consumer trust.

Key features include:

✅ On-chain Product Registration: Producers can register their products directly on the blockchain.

🔐 Immutable Certification Data: Each product is tagged with a certification timestamp.

🔍 Verification Mechanism: Verifiers (currently unrestricted) can mark products as verified.

🌐 Public Transparency: All registered products and their states are accessible on-chain, ensuring data cannot be tampered with.

🔭 Project Vision
We envision a transparent, tamper-proof ecosystem that empowers consumers, regulators, and producers by:

Enhancing Consumer Trust: Consumers can verify fair trade claims through the blockchain.

Supporting Ethical Producers: Producers gain credibility through independently verifiable certifications.

Fostering a Global Fair Trade Network: Creating a standard, decentralized registry that can be adopted globally by fair trade organizations and communities.
